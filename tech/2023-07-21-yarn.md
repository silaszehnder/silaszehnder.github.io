A lot:

- unifying on a single version of webpack
- gulp??
- fixing tests
- making all those changes and not causing downtime for developers

## Preface

Prior to this project, I didn't know anything about [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or
frontend build systems in general. Frontend "stuff" has never been my jam, but improving
build experience and efficiency definitely is. With that in mind, please pardon my
ignorance if I use some incorrect terminology throughout this article, and please let me
know if any edits should be made to improve clarity!

A few people had made multiple partial strides to help get this closer to the finish
line prior to my involvement, but it was clearly going to take some focused effort to
connect the dots and get to a point where the migration would be truly feasible. Despite
the large hurdles in the way, the performance gains and other quality-of-life
improvements for developers promised at the end of the migration were too good to leave
on the table.

## tl;dr

Switching over to [Yarn Plug 'n' Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) from
node_modules is an arduous process in a monorepo. You have to:

- refactor first-party package dependency configurations
- modify third-party package dependencies through `packageExtensions` to add
  dependencies that they might not explicitly call out themselves
- update third-party packages to versions that support the `pnp` `nodeLinker`, or patch
  them so that they do
- many other minute tweaks that the article will cover (at least the ones I still
  remember!)

These changes need to be compatible with both Plug 'n' Play _and_ node_modules, as you
can't incrementally switch packages over to Plug 'n' Play; the entire repo has to use
Plug 'n' Play in an all-or-nothing config change. So, you have to constantly switch your
local config over to use the `pnp` [`nodeLinker`
](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker), make sure things build and test
successfully, then make sure they still work as intended with node_modules, merge your
changes, rinse and repeat as you constantly keep up with package changes coming in from
developer teams. Then, once _everything_ is finally working and building, switch over
the repo's `nodeLinker` to `pnp` and hope for the best!

## Context and status quo

### What is Yarn Plug'n'Play?

[Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp), hereby referenced as PnP, works by
"[telling] Yarn to generate a single Node.js loader file in place of the typical
`node_modules` folder. This loader file, named `.pnp.cjs`, contains all information
about your project's dependency tree, informing your tools as to the location of the
packages on the disk and letting them know how to resolve require and import calls."[^0]

So, instead of resolving imports directly from the `node_modules` folder where they've
been fully decompressed and installed, `.pnp.cjs` contains what is essentially a map
from a package reference to its location internally within the zip file of the package
within Yarn's package cache. Here's a snippet from [`berry/.pnp.cjs`
](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/.pnp.cjs) which might better visualize
what's happening:

```
    ["callsites", [\
      ["npm:3.0.0", {\
        "packageLocation": "./.yarn/cache/callsites-npm-3.0.0-4966cb90f4-40e3cb2027.zip/node_modules/callsites/",\
        "packageDependencies": [\
          ["callsites", "npm:3.0.0"]\
        ],\
        "linkType": "HARD"\
      }]\
    ]],\
```

So, when `callsites` is referenced, Yarn knows to resolve the import from right within
the `zip` file! No need to decompress and install the cache to the `node_modules`
directory. Cool, but why would this benefit us?

### Why would we want to use PnP anyway?

Here's a gist of what we were dealing with prior to the switch to PnP.

- A multi-language monorepo with many services, each with their own `package.json`, with
  a root `package.json` which points to all the [workspaces](
  https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces#what-are-workspaces) within the repo.
- Most services use the same version of common dependencies, but this isn't always a
  guarantee. In some services, outdated versions of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  were being used which didn't support PnP out of the box. There were also a bunch of
  other packages which required major version upgrades to get to versions which
  supported PnP.
- The local build environment is a Docker container running through Docker Desktop on
  macOS
- Build time for one of the larger services would take **approximately 13 minutes** when
  using a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) from host to
  container for the container's working tree. Build time _could_ be noticeably decreased
  by using a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) instead of a bind mount
  for the working tree, but this introduced an intermediate "sync" step between host and
  container for the majority of developer operations (not just builds) in order to get
  the up-to-date working tree from the host into the container. One of the major
  downsides of this is **slow container creation**, resulting in many developers
  treating their containers as pets, not cattle[^1], understandably so.
  - Building the "world" when using a bind mount would result in a `node_modules`
    directory of multiple GBs **which would have to hop across the host to container
    boundary during the build, resulting in a ton of file I/O bottleneck.** Bind mount
    performance actually performed worse than volume performance, even _with_ the volume
    sync step!

By default, we were using a volume for the working tree. We could keep this as-is, but
the step of syncing the host's working tree into the container was adding minutes to
container creation time and multiple seconds to a lot of common operations. In general,
it was a significant developer productivity hindrance.

However, removing that volume and therefore the sync step by using a bind-mount instead
was not serving developers any better. While container creation and common operations
were now "syncless" and therefore gained a bunch of time savings, that time savings was
completely eaten up by now slower build times.

File I/O across the bind-mount simply couldn't keep up with the build process, as
multiple files were constantly being created/referenced/etc. within the host's
node_modules directory. If only there were a way to drastically reduce the amount of
file I/O required during the build... what if the entire node_modules directory was
replaced with a single file called something like, say, `.pnp.cjs`? Then, we might be
able to use a bind-mount and benefit from the performance gains from syncless _and_ have
speedy builds not bottlenecked by file I/O!

The potential developer experience and performance gains were too hard to pass up, we
had to try and make this work.

## Getting started

Before diving in, there were some guides available on the subject of moving from
node_modules to PnP. Some of which were internal runbooks that engineers had put
together, outlining what package upgrades and config changes would be necessary in order
to get our packages in a PnP-supportable state. This pre-work was invaluable, as I was
able to hit the ground running and see their efforts through across the whole codebase.

Along with this internal help, Yarn itself provided some "recipes" to help with the
transition. I tossed a message in the Yarn discord looking for some more help before I
went off and did my own thing:

> szehnder â€” 08/12/2022 9:38 AM ðŸ‘‹ hello! I'm currently working on migrating a monorepo
> over to using PnP (using yarn v3 fyi). The [Hybrid PnP + node_modules mono-repo](
> https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/recipes/#hybrid-pnp--node_modules-mono-repo)
> recipe is helpful, but I'm wondering if there is a recommended path for a hybrid
> approach where PnP is opt-in, rather than the other way around like the above recipe
> suggests. Thanks in advance!

## The gameplan

I didn't hear back, so I had to do some thinking about how to go about doing this
without causing downtime for our devs. If PnP can't be opt-in, then the switch to PnP
will need to happen in one fell swoop, which is much easier said than done! This is what
I came up with:

> szehnder â€” 08/29/2022 11:56 AM After some searching, it seems like there isn't strong
> support for linking PnP-based packages to node-modules-based packages, which makes
> sense. I have instead opted to do the following, in case it helps anyone else:
>
> - switch .yarnrc.yml over to nodeLinker:pnp
> - attempt to yarn install and subsequently build atomic components within the monorepo
>   with PnP
> - after making necessary tweaks to successfully build, switch back to nodeLinker:
>   node-modules and yarn install and build with the changes I made for PnP, just to
>   verfy it works in node-modules world as well
> - put up a diff for the atomic component, not adding .pnp.cjs and keeping the
>   nodeLinker as node-modules
>
> once all of these piecemeal changes have been made and committed, I'll commit the
> nodeLinker:pnp change and the .pnp.cjs file, and we should ideally be able to make a
> somewhat painless switch over to PnP
>
> I have written a helper script that toggles my environment between one that uses
> .pnp.cjs and node_modules/, so i am not spending a ton of time waiting for either to
> repopulate when switching my nodeLinker between the two

The process outlined above really did end up being the main workflow for handling the
migration:

- run my `pnp-toggle` script
- try and build a package
- resolve failures that pop up through a myriad of different fixes
- once it built with PnP, run `pnp-toggle` and try and build it with node_modules to see
  if it still worked
- merge the changes _without_ switching the repo over to PnP as the nodeLinker

By following this process, devs were completely unaffected and didn't notice any
difference while packages were being prepped for PnP. Ultimately, the only thing
affected was my MacBook's CPU[^2].

### Hindsight?

Thinking more about this now, I wonder if the recipe could be leveraged in a way where:

- the global nodeLinker is set to pnp
- every package explicitly sets their linker to node-modules
- every package gets added to `pnpIgnorePatterns`
- Make packages "opt-in" to PnP by removing their local `.yarnrc.yml` and removing them
  from `pnpIgnorePatterns`

## The experience

need to get it done quick since new stuff slips in all the time

## The results

- 13 minutes down to 2.5 minutes!
- "syncless" default container behavior! you get a bind mount, you get a bind mount

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have others gone through a similar migration? Did you do things differently that
resulted in a less painful process? I'm curious to hear about other experiences!
