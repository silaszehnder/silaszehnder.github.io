# Professional

Currently working as a full-time software engineer.

Highlights from internships include
* supporting a project to emulate a PowerPC processor in C/C++/Python
* working in a SOC and gaining deeper understanding of cybersecurity and how it pertains to software engineering
* getting Security+ certified

I also spent 3 summers cleaning carpets which certainly didn't teach me anything technical, but definitely taught me about hard work and earning your worth.

# Educational

Bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan College of Engineering.

Graduated in 2019.

Highlights from coursework include
* Advanced embedded systems, created [The Brewhob](/projects#brewhob)
* Intro to embedded systems, created [The Auto-Otamatone](/projects#otamatone)
* Computer networks (streaming, CDNs, proxies, TCP/UDP, sockets, client-server applications)
* Operating systems (CPU scheduling, mutexes/CVs/threads, memory management, file systems)
* Web systems (full-stack development, databasing, security topics, tf-idf, PageRank)
* Data structures and algorithms (lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, trees, searching/sorting/recursive/graph algorithms)

# Personal

Currently living in the Denver area.

My typical weekend includes hiking, climbing, video games, and improving on my incredibly average music production and piano skills. I might upload some original tracks once I feel good enough about them.

Music is one of my biggest hobbies. I am constantly looking for new music to listen to and am open to all genres (well, except country).

Favorite albums:
* Stevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life
* Marvin Gaye - What's Going On
* Frank Ocean - Blonde
* Mac Demarco - This Old Dog
* Benny Sings - City Pop
* The Strokes - Is This It
* Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki & Tatsuro Yamashita - Pacific

I want a dog but can't bring myself to pay the monthly fee to have one at my apartment.
