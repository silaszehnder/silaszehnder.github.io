title: The Auto-Otamatone
---

This monstrosity was created in an introductory embedded systems course. The
[Otamatone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otamatone) is a fretless toy instrument that
is incredibly hard to play in tune. Due to the fretless neck, there is no good way to
tell where any real notes are located.

We decided to take all our knowledge of FPGAs, MMIO, serial communication, verilog, and
low-level C programming and make a self-tuning otamatone that can be controlled with a
MIDI keyboard. Unnecessary? Yes. Hilarious? Yes.
