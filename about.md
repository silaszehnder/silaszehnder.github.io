# Professional

Currently working as a full-time software engineer.

Highlights from internships include
* supporting a project to emulate a PowerPC processor in C/C++/Python
* working in a SOC and gaining deeper understanding of cybersecurity and how it pertains to software engineering
* getting Security+ certified

I also spent 3 summers cleaning carpets which certainly didn't teach me anything technical, but definitely taught me about hard work and earning your worth.

# Educational

Graduated in 2019.

Highlights from coursework include
* Advanced embedded systems, created [The Brewhob](/projects)
* Intro to embedded systems, created [The Auto-Otamatone](/projects)
* Computer networks (streaming, CDNs, proxies, TCP/UDP, sockets, client-server applications)
* Operating systems (CPU scheduling, mutexes/CVs/threads, memory management, file systems)
* Web systems (full-stack development, databasing, security topics, tf-idf, PageRank)

# Personal

Currently living in the Denver area.

My typical weekend includes hiking, climbing, music production, and video games.

Music is easily my biggest hobby. I am constantly looking for new music to listen to and am open to all genres (well, except country).
