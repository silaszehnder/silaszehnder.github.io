title: What it takes to migrate a monorepo from node_modules to .pnp.cjs
categories: tech

A lot:

- updating shared dependencies
- explicitly defining dependencies
- unifying on a single version of webpack
- gulp??
- fixing tests
- making all those changes and not causing downtime for developers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Preface

Prior to this project, I didn't know anything about Yarn or frontend build systems in
general. Truly, nothing. All I knew was a few people had tried making this migration
happen, but it was clearly not a trivial effort and would require an engineer's full
focus for a few months. However, the performance gains (and other QoL improvements)
promised on the other side were too good to ignore. Plus, all the melting intel MacBooks
were depending on us!

## Context and status quo

Here's a quick gist of what we were dealing with prior to the switch to Yarn's [PnP
feature](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp):

- Dealing with a multi-language monorepo with many services, each with their own
  `package.json`s.
- Most services use the same version of common dependencies, but this isn't always a
  guarantee. Some needed their version of webpack upgraded, along with a bunch of other
  somewhat major dependency upgrades.
- The build environment is a Docker container running through Docker Desktop on macOS
- Building the "world" would result in a top-level `node_modules/` directory of multiple
  GBs, all hopping across the host-container boundary during the build, resulting in a
  ton of disk I/O bottleneck.
- Build time for one of the larger services would take approximately 13 minutes when
  using a bind mount for the container's disk. Build time could be noticeably decreased
  by using a volume instead of a bind mount, but this introduced an intermediate "sync"
  step between host and container for the majority of operations, not just builds. This
  resulted in slow container creation, resulting in many developers treating their
  containers as pets, not cattle[^0], understandably so.

## Getting started

It all started with a mesage in the Yarn discord:

> szehnder â€” 08/12/2022 9:38 AM ðŸ‘‹ hello! I'm currently working on migrating a monorepo
> over to using PnP (using yarn v3 fyi). The [Hybrid PnP + node_modules mono-repo](

> approach where PnP is opt-in, rather than the other way around like the above recipe
> suggests. Thanks in advance!

## The gameplan

I didn't hear back, so I had to do some thinking about how to go about doing this
without causing downtime for our devs. If PnP can't be opt-in, then the switch to PnP
will need to happen in one fell swoop, which is much easier said than done! This is what
I came up with:

> szehnder â€” 08/29/2022 11:56 AM After some searching, it seems like there isn't strong
> support for linking PnP-based packages to node-modules-based packages, which makes
> sense. I have instead opted to do the following, in case it helps anyone else:
>
> - switch .yarnrc.yml over to nodeLinker:pnp
> - attempt to yarn install and subsequently build atomic components within the monorepo
>   with PnP
> - after making necessary tweaks to successfully build, switch back to nodeLinker:
>   node-modules and yarn install and build with the changes I made for PnP, just to
>   verfy it works in node-modules world as well
> - put up a diff for the atomic component, not adding .pnp.cjs and keeping the
>   nodeLinker as node-modules
>
> once all of these piecemeal changes have been made and committed, I'll commit the
> nodeLinker:pnp change and the .pnp.cjs file, and we should ideally be able to make a
> somewhat painless switch over to PnP
>
> I have written a helper script that toggles my environment between one that uses
> .pnp.cjs and node_modules/, so i am not spending a ton of time waiting for either to
> repopulate when switching my nodeLinker between the two

Thinking more about this now, I don't know if it makes sense to not support
cross-linking PnP- and node_modules-backed packages. Knowing more about the system now,
it doesn't seem like there would be any technical limitation to allowing this type of
behavior, other than maybe some performance hit when trying to resolve packages in both
systems. But anyway...

The process outlined above really did end up being the main workflow for handling the
migration -- run my `pnp-toggle` script, try and build a package, resolve failures that
pop up through a myriad of different fixes, once it built with PnP, run `pnp-toggle` and
try and build it with node_modules to see if it still worked. Then, merge the changes
_without_ switching the repo over to PnP as the nodeLinker. Devs didn't notice any
difference, the only thing affected was my MacBook's CPU[^1].

## The experience

need to get it done quick since new stuff slips in all the time

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have others gone through a similar migration? Did you do things differently that
resulted in a less painful process? I'm curious to know what others ran into when doing

[^1]: By the end of this effort, my MacBook CPU was legitimately cooked. Things started
breaking in very weird ways, and diagnostics at the Genius Bar reported back that it had
seen sustained high temperature events very frequently. 8 hours of compilation a day can
do that I guess.
